Final project for CSCI2275

Project Title: Game Tree for Tic-Tac-Toe

Summary: The purpose of this project is to create a game using a game tree with many functionalities such as going back a move, finding what the optimal move is (for computer or player), and having a functional player vs. computer mode where the computer attempts to beat the player.

Use run.sh to run the program.

The program does not require any third party libraries.

I do not think there are any system requirements

There were no contributors

This is not necessarily a bug but the program will not always win immediately if it see that it will win in the future.
