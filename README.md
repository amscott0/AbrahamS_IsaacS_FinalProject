Final project for CSCI2275

Project Title: Game Tree for Tic-Tac-Toe

Summary: The purpose of this project is to create a game using a game tree with many functionalities such as going back a move, finding what the optimal move is (for computer or player), and having a functional player vs. computer mode where the computer attempts to beat the player. The AI part of the project is done by the use of a miniMax() function and an evaluateMove() function that assigns a heuristic value to game boards. The miniMax() function calls the evaluateMove() function and uses it to determine whether the current game board is beneficial to the player or the computer.

Use run.sh to run the program. From here, you will be prompted by a menu, type and enter 1 to play game, then enter your difficulty.
You will then see a menu full of multiple game functions.

This is not necessarily a bug but the program will not always win immediately if it see that it will win in the future.
